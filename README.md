## ðŸ“Š Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing datasets for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identifying patterns, outliers, and correlations.  
3. **Visualization** â€“ Creating both static and interactive plots to present findings.  
4. **Insight Generation** â€“ Drawing conclusions from statistical and visual patterns.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Findings  
- **Regional Price Variations** â€“  
  - Coastal cities and metropolitan areas consistently record higher price ranges.  
  - Northern and rural regions generally have lower prices.  

- **Size vs. Price Relationship** â€“  
  - In southern Brazil, there is a strong positive correlation between property size and price.  
  - Exceptions occur in highly urbanized zones, where location outweighs size in pricing.  

- **Market Hotspots** â€“  
  - SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro lead in median property prices.  
  - Secondary cities in the south show rapid growth potential for investment.  

- **Distribution Patterns** â€“  
  - Price distribution is heavily skewed with a small percentage of luxury properties dominating the high-price segment.
